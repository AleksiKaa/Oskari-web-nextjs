title: How do I get the license for Oskari?
---

The source code for Oskari is open source. It is being kept flexible in order to broaden it with new components, use it with different service platforms and for changing the software libraries if needed. The UI supports multilingualism and there are already multiple languages translated. All source code is being published with MIT/EUPL licenses.
