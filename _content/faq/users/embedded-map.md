title: How do I create embedded maps from Oskari?
---

If you don’t want to set up Oskari installation, don’t worry you can still enjoy the ride. You can build fancy & tailored map views based on Published maps functionality in Oskari. This requires an Oskari installation that has enabled the Published map functionality. If you are registered to the Oskari site you want to use, add the map layers you need to the map and click Published maps. Follow the instructions and embedd the iframe code you get in the end to your website.
